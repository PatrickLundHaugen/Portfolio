                    "It was also the first time I integrated an API, so it was a lot of new stuff at once. Luckily, I already had some experience from earlier small projects using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so the transition wasn't as overwhelming as it could have been. Even though the learning curve was steep, it was super fun to see how things started to come together, from component structure and styling to data fetching and dynamic content.",

The first image shows as a hero image, while the rest appear in a gallery that scrolls endlessly. It's a simple concept, but it looks pretty cool.",

Afterwards, I started thinking about ways to expand it, perhaps by adding more interactivity, advanced logic, or exploring some new concepts I've learned since. But as usual, other projects and obligations got in the way.",
                    "Still, I really value what I learned from the experience. The code might feel a bit outdated now, both visually and technically, as there are many things I'd do differently today. I definitely see the potential to revisit it with fresh eyes and improved skills if the motivation strikes. The most important part is that it gave me a solid foundation for diving into modern, efficient web development."

The idea was to create something genuinely helpful for my daily life, rather than just a technical showcase I wouldn't end up using. So far, I've implemented several features, including a chat tool integrated with Gemini, a bookmarking system, and a simple notepad.",

As mentioned above, I integrated Gemini. That was a fairly straightforward process, since the API works similarly to many others. I chose Gemini over ChatGPT mainly because it's free and, in many cases, a better option.",
                    "Another important, but less visible part of the project is the flexible layout. I used dnd-kit, a library for drag-and-drop functionality, which lets users rearrange and resize the cards on the page however they like.",
                    "For data storage, I've currently opted for localStorage. It's simple and works well enough to keep user data between sessions. A database would of course provide more robust storage, but for this stage of the project, localStorage is more than sufficient. That's something I could build on later if the need arises.",
                    "I've paused development for now due to other commitments, but I absolutely plan to keep working on Dashboard regularly. There are endless possibilities for improvements, both small tweaks and larger additions.",
